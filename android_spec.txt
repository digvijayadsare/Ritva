PARAMPARA - ANDROID MVP SPECIFICATION

1. FIREBASE DATA MODEL (Firestore)
----------------------------------
- Collections:
  - users: { uid: string, name: string, phone: string, familyId: string, role: "ADMIN" | "MEMBER" }
  - families: { id: string, name: string, adminId: string, members: string[] }
  - traditions: { 
      id: string, familyId: string, title: string, category: string, description: string,
      linkedFestivalId: string?, linkedTithi: { month: string, paksha: string, tithi: number }?,
      steps: [ { id: string, title: string, instructions: string, mediaUrl: string, mediaType: "VIDEO" | "IMAGE" } ]
    }
  - ancestors: { id: string, familyId: string, name: string, relation: string, photoUrl: string, punyaTithi: { month: string, paksha: string, tithi: number } }
  - festivals: { id: string, name: string, tithi: { month: string, paksha: string, tithi: number }, generalDescription: string }

2. PANCHANG INTEGRATION APPROACH
-------------------------------
- For a native Android app, use a custom Panchang calculator library or a server-side Cloud Function that wraps ephemeris data (e.g., Swiss Ephemeris) to provide Tithi conversion for the specific year.
- Amanta vs Purnimanta: The requirement specifies Amanta (predominant in South/West India).
- Calendar Mapping logic: 
  - Each day, fetch Tithi data from local room DB or Firebase.
  - A Tithi can start at any time; typically, the Tithi prevailing at sunrise is the Tithi for the day.

3. KOTLIN SCAFFOLDING GUIDANCE
-----------------------------
- Auth: Use Firebase Phone Auth `PhoneAuthProvider.getInstance()`.
- Navigation: Jetpack Navigation Component with BottomNavigationView.
- Media: use CameraX for video/photo capture and Firebase Storage for uploading.
- Steps: Use a RecyclerView with ListAdapter for dynamic step lists in the "Create" screen.

4. ASSUMPTIONS & CONSTRAINTS
---------------------------
- The MVP assumes a fixed Amanta month system.
- Video length is capped at 10 minutes to manage storage costs.
- User location (needed for precise Panchang) is defaulted to India Standard Time (IST).
